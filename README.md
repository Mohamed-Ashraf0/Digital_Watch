# Digital_Watch
Verilog Digital Watch FSM📖 Project OverviewThis project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) controller for a digital watch with a 4-digit, 24-hour format display. Designed in Verilog HDL, the system replicates the functionality of a classic "Casio-style" digital watch.The core challenge of this design is managing complex system behaviors—including timekeeping, alarm settings, and a stopwatch—using a constrained user interface of only two push-buttons.✨ Features24-Hour Time Format: Standard HH:MM timekeeping.Sequential FSM: Robust 10-state architecture for mode navigation.Granular Setting: Adjust time and alarm values digit-by-digit (Tens/Ones for Hours/Minutes).Stopwatch: Counts MM:SS with a Split-Time feature (freeze display while counting).Synchronous Design: Fully synchronous logic suitable for synthesis on FPGA hardware.🎮 Controls & InterfaceThe watch is controlled using only two input buttons.Input SignalFunctionalitymode_buttonNavigation: Cycles through the operational modes (Normal $\to$ Set Time $\to$ Set Alarm $\to$ Stopwatch).set_split_buttonAction: • In Setting Modes: Increments the currently selected digit.• In Stopwatch Mode: Toggles "Split Mode" (freezes display).rstSystem Reset: Returns FSM to Normal Mode and clears all counters to 00:00.clkSystem Clock: Master clock signal.⚙️ Finite State Machine (FSM) ArchitectureThe controller utilizes a 4-bit state register to cycle through 10 distinct states.State Transition DiagramNormal Mode $\rightarrow$ Time Set Sequence $\rightarrow$ Alarm Set Sequence $\rightarrow$ Stopwatch $\rightarrow$ (Loop)Detailed State ListThe FSM is encoded as follows:NORMAL_MODE (0): Standard time display.TIME_SET (1-4):Set Hours Tens $\to$ Set Hours Ones $\to$ Set Minutes Tens $\to$ Set Minutes Ones.ALARM_SET (5-8):Set Alarm Hours Tens $\to$ Set Alarm Hours Ones $\to$ Set Alarm Minutes Tens $\to$ Set Alarm Minutes Ones.STOPWATCH_MODE (9): Stopwatch display.🛠️ Hardware LogicDigit Increment LogicThe set_split_button respects the 24-hour format limits depending on the current state:Hours Tens: 0-2Hours Ones: 0-9 (or 0-3 if Tens is 2)Minutes Tens: 0-5Minutes Ones: 0-9Stopwatch LogicThe stopwatch runs in the background. Pressing set_split_button in this mode enables the Split Flag.Flag High: Display is frozen (holds current value), counter continues internally.Flag Low: Display updates real-time.📂 Directory
